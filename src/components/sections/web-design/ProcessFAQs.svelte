      <p>
        In order to find out where you're going, we need to figure out where you've been. That's why
        our discovery starts with assessing your current rankings, keywords, UX, and design
        shortcomings.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        With that in mind, we also assess your competition - whether local or online. What are they
        targeting? What is and isn't working for them?
      </p>

      <span>Sitemap and Wireframe</span>
    {/snippet}
    {#snippet answer()}
      <p>
        Leveraging the keywords and discoveries made in the previous step, we create a sitemap of
        your new site. A sitemap for a website is a structured list or blueprint that outlines the
        pages, sections, and content of the site, helping both users and search engines navigate and
        understand its structure. It serves as a roadmap for the website's layout and content
        hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        With the sitemap in hand, we go about creating a wireframe of each individual page. A
        wireframe is a low-fidelity, visual representation or blueprint of a website or
        application's layout and structure. It outlines the basic design elements and functionality
        of the site, such as the placement of navigation menus, buttons, images, text, and other key
        components, without focusing on visual design details like colors or fonts.

      <p>
        The wirefame is then iterated on while following some agreed upon desgin principles, colors,
        branding, and feel to create a high fidelity design. This is the final product you're used
        to seeing on social media and other platforms.

        ourselves, we deliver your design in full with a packet containing all the previous steps.
