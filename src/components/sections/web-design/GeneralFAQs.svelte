      <p>
        Much like our <a href="web-development">web development</a> services, it very much depends. We
        believe in a fully collaborative process, so the more responsive you are, the faster we can move.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        On average a new website design can take anywhere from 2-3 weeks for a simple site to 12+
        weeks for a more complex website.

      <span>How many revisions do you allow?</span>
    {/snippet}
    {#snippet answer()}
      <p>
        For both wireframing and design steps, we typically limit revisions to three rounds. That
        is, we ask that you look over the wireframe or design, sit on it for 24-48 hours, and then
        provide feedback in one fell swoop.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        With the provided feedback, we can meet together to discuss each and every item, then we
        deliver the next iteration for another round of comments/discussion. If more work is needed
        after that, we typically move to an hourly rate, at $120/hr.
